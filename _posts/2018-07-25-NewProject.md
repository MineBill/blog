So i just started working on another project, focusing on mulitplayer. Instead of a pvp game that will require A LOT of mesing around with the code and a big player base to sustain it, i decided to go with something else. A co-op game. The game idea i pretty simple which will make everything much easier(hopefully) and will allow me to learn "multiplayer-coding" faster. I've already decided that i'll use Photon because it looks much more simpler that Unity's built in system(which i haven't really used to be honest) so i'm really excited!

I've already got some basics down -like player movement, basic hosting/joining- and i hope i'll add much more over the next days. I'm thinking of posting 
here daily as a way to help me stay organised and motivated(?). We'll see.
